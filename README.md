# UNIX-Scripts
Repository of helpful scripts I've created and used in the UNIX environment

* *slideshow.py*: Given a path to a directory of images, generates an XML file 
usable in desktop background slideshows in the MATE desktop environment

* *backlight.sh*: Manipulates the backlight of Intel graphics-based computers. Particularly useful in Trisquel. An argument of '91' will raise the brightness by 91 units, while an argument of '-91' will lower the brightness by 91 units. Adjust based on your computer's needs.
